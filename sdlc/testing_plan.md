### Testing Plan

#### Testing Strategies:

1. **Unit Testing:**
    - Developers will perform unit testing for individual components, focusing on
      functionality, error handling, and boundary cases.
    - Test cases will be automated using testing frameworks like pytest for backend
      services and Jest for frontend components.

2. **Integration Testing:**
    - Integration tests will validate interactions between different microservices,
      APIs, and external systems.
    - Mocking frameworks like MockServer or Mockito will be used to simulate external
      dependencies and ensure consistent behavior during testing.

3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    - E2E tests will verify the system's functionality from end to end, simulating user
      interactions and scenarios.
    - Tools like Selenium or Cypress will be used for browser automation and E2E testing
      of the user interface.

4. **Performance Testing:**
    - Performance tests will evaluate the system's responsiveness, throughput, and
      scalability under different load conditions.
    - Load testing tools like JMeter or Gatling will be used to simulate concurrent
      users and measure response times and resource utilization.

5. **Security Testing:**
    - Security tests will identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security
      best practices and standards.
    - Static code analysis tools like SonarQube and vulnerability scanners like OWASP
      ZAP will be used to detect security flaws and weaknesses.

#### Test Cases:

1. **User Management:**
    - Verify user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Test user registration, login, profile management, and password reset
      functionalities.

2. **KPI Data Collection:**
    - Validate CRUD operations for managing KPI data.
    - Test data validation and integrity checks for input parameters and formats.

3. **Real-time Monitoring:**
    - Verify real-time updates and visualizations on the dashboard.
    - Test alerting mechanisms for critical network events and threshold breaches.

4. **Historical Analysis:**
    - Validate historical data retrieval and trend analysis functionalities.
    - Test reporting and visualization features for historical KPI metrics.

5. **Notifications:**
    - Verify the delivery and content of notifications for different alert scenarios.
    - Test notification preferences and settings for users.

#### Testing Criteria:

1. **Functionality:**
    - Ensure that all features and functionalities meet the specified requirements.
    - Validate user workflows and interactions in different scenarios.

2. **Performance:**
    - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization under various load
      conditions.
    - Ensure that the system can handle the expected user traffic and data volume.

3. **Security:**
    - Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site
      scripting (XSS), and authentication bypass.
    - Ensure data encryption, secure communication, and access control mechanisms are
      properly implemented.

4. **Usability:**
    - Evaluate the user interface for clarity, intuitiveness, and accessibility.
    - Verify that users can navigate the system easily and perform tasks efficiently.

5. **Reliability:**
    - Validate system stability and reliability under normal and adverse conditions.
    - Ensure proper error handling, logging, and recovery mechanisms are in place.
