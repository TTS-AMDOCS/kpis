### Design Specifications

#### Architecture:

1. **Microservices Architecture:**
    - The system will be designed using a microservices architecture to ensure
      scalability, modularity, and maintainability.
    - Each functional module, such as user management, KPI data collection, real-time
      monitoring, and historical analysis, will be implemented as a separate
      microservice.
    - Communication between microservices will be facilitated through lightweight
      protocols like HTTP or message queues.

2. **Component Overview:**
    - **User Management Service:** Handles user authentication, authorization, and
      profile management.
    - **KPI Data Collection Service:** Responsible for collecting, storing, and
      processing KPI data from various sources, including network devices and external
      APIs.
    - **Real-time Monitoring Service:** Provides real-time visualization of KPI metrics
      through customizable dashboards and alerts.
    - **Historical Analysis Service:** Manages historical data storage and facilitates
      trend analysis and reporting functionalities.
    - **Notification Service:** Sends alerts and notifications to users based on
      predefined thresholds and anomalies in KPI metrics.
    - **External Integration Service:** Facilitates integration with external systems
      and data sources through APIs and connectors.

#### Use Case Specific Design:

1. **User Management:**
    - **Use Case:** Admin creates a new user account.
        - **Design:** The admin interacts with the User Management Service through the
          admin dashboard.
        - **Technical Specification:** User Management Service exposes RESTful APIs for
          CRUD operations on user accounts. Admin privileges are required to access
          these APIs.

2. **KPI Data Collection:**
    - **Use Case:** Operator submits KPI data manually.
        - **Design:** Operator interacts with the KPI Data Collection Service through a
          user-friendly interface.
        - **Technical Specification:** KPI Data Collection Service provides web forms or
          API endpoints for operators to input KPI data. Data validation mechanisms are
          implemented to ensure data integrity.

3. **Real-time Monitoring:**
    - **Use Case:** User views real-time KPI metrics on the dashboard.
        - **Design:** User accesses the Real-time Monitoring Service through the web
          application.
        - **Technical Specification:** Real-time Monitoring Service utilizes WebSocket
          connections to push live updates of KPI metrics to the user interface. Data
          visualization components such as charts and graphs are used to present KPI
          data.

4. **Historical Analysis:**
    - **Use Case:** User generates a historical report for trend analysis.
        - **Design:** User interacts with the Historical Analysis Service through the
          reporting module.
        - **Technical Specification:** Historical Analysis Service provides APIs for
          querying historical data based on user-defined parameters. Data aggregation
          and analysis algorithms are implemented to generate meaningful insights.

5. **Notifications:**
    - **Use Case:** User receives an alert for a critical network issue.
        - **Design:** User receives notifications via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.
        - **Technical Specification:** Notification Service monitors KPI metrics in
          real-time and triggers alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded.
          Integration with third-party notification services such as Twilio or SendGrid
          is implemented for delivering notifications.

#### Technical Stack:

1. **Backend:**
    - **Framework:** FastAPI for building high-performance asynchronous APIs.
    - **Database:** Mysql for storing user profiles, KPI data, and historical
      records.
    - **Messaging:** RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between microservices.
    - **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing API endpoints and user
      sessions.

2. **Frontend:**
    - **Framework:** React.js for building responsive and interactive user interfaces.
    - **Data Visualization:** Chart.js or D3.js for creating dynamic charts and graphs.
    - **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket for enabling real-time updates of KPI metrics on
      the dashboard.

3. **Infrastructure:**
    - **Cloud Platform:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) for hosting and scaling the
      application.
    - **Containerization:** Docker for packaging microservices into containers.
    - **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for container orchestration and management.
