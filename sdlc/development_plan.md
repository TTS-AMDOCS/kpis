### Development Plan

#### Schedule:

1. **Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering (Duration: 2 weeks)**
   - Define project scope, objectives, and requirements.
   - Conduct stakeholder meetings to gather feedback and finalize specifications.
   - Create detailed documentation, including system requirements, use cases, and
     design specifications.

2. **Phase 2: Design and Architecture (Duration: 4 weeks)**
   - Design the system architecture, including microservices, databases, and
     integration points.
   - Develop technical specifications for each component and define API contracts.
   - Prototype user interfaces and iterate based on user feedback.
   - Conduct architecture review sessions with development team and stakeholders.

3. **Phase 3: Implementation (Duration: 12 weeks)**
   - Develop backend microservices using FastAPI framework for CRUD operations and
     business logic.
   - Implement frontend user interface using React.js with real-time data visualization
     capabilities.
   - Integrate with external systems and APIs for data collection and reporting.
   - Conduct code reviews, unit testing, and integration testing to ensure code quality
     and functionality.

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance (Duration: 6 weeks)**
   - Conduct comprehensive testing, including functional testing, performance testing,
     and security testing.
   - Develop test cases and execute test scenarios to validate system behavior.
   - Address any bugs or issues identified during testing and perform regression
     testing as needed.
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) and gather
     feedback for further improvements.

5. **Phase 5: Deployment and Launch (Duration: 2 weeks)**
   - Prepare deployment environments, including staging and production servers.
   - Deploy the system to production environment and perform final system checks.
   - Conduct user training sessions and provide documentation for system usage.
   - Monitor system performance and address any issues that arise during the initial
     launch period.
