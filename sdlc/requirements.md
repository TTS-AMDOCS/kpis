### System Requirements

#### Functional Requirements:

1. **User Management:**
   - The system should support multiple user roles such as admin, operator, and viewer.
   - Admin users should have the ability to manage user accounts, including creating,
     updating, and deleting user profiles.
   - User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure
     secure access to the system.

2. **KPI Data Collection:**
   - The system should provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for
     managing KPI data.
   - Users should be able to input KPI data manually or through automated data
     collection mechanisms.
   - Data validation mechanisms should be implemented to ensure the integrity and
     accuracy of the collected KPI data.

3. **Real-time Monitoring:**
   - The system should display real-time KPI metrics to users, providing instant
     insights into network performance and availability.
   - Users should be able to customize the dashboard to display KPIs relevant to their
     specific roles and responsibilities.
   - Real-time alerts and notifications should be triggered based on predefined
     thresholds or anomalies in KPI metrics.

4. **Historical Analysis:**
   - The system should maintain a historical database of KPI data, allowing users to
     perform trend analysis and historical comparisons.
   - Users should be able to generate historical reports and visualizations to analyze
     KPI performance over time.

5. **Alarms and Notifications:**
   - The system should support configurable alarm thresholds for critical KPI metrics.
   - Users should receive notifications via email, SMS, or in-app alerts when KPI
     metrics exceed predefined thresholds or indicate network issues.

6. **Data Export and Integration:**
   - The system should allow users to export KPI data in various formats such as CSV,
     Excel, or PDF for further analysis or reporting.
   - Integration with external systems such as network management tools or analytics
     platforms should be supported through APIs or data connectors.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:

1. **Performance:**
   - The system should be capable of handling a high volume of concurrent users and KPI
     data transactions without performance degradation.
   - Response times for data retrieval and dashboard rendering should be optimized for
     real-time monitoring and analysis.

2. **Scalability:**
   - The system architecture should be scalable to accommodate future growth in data
     volume and user traffic.
   - Horizontal scaling mechanisms such as load balancing and auto-scaling should be
     implemented to handle increased workload demands.

3. **Reliability:**
   - The system should be highly available and resilient to failures, with built-in
     redundancy and failover mechanisms.
   - Data integrity and consistency should be ensured through transaction management
     and database replication strategies.

4. **Security:**
   - The system should enforce strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to
     prevent unauthorized access to sensitive KPI data.
   - Data encryption should be employed to protect data transmission and storage,
     especially for sensitive information such as user credentials and KPI metrics.

5. **Usability:**
   - The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear navigation
     and visualizations to facilitate easy interpretation of KPI data.
   - Accessibility standards should be followed to ensure the system is usable by users
     with disabilities.

6. **Compliance:**
   - The system should comply with relevant regulatory requirements and industry
     standards for data privacy, security, and telecommunications.
